* Help! My GitLab CI pipeline is not running.

You may encounter a problem where your GitLab CI pipeline is not running.

Make sure that:

- You have named your file .gitlab-ci.yml (and not gitlab-ci.yml or .gitlab-ci.yaml)

- the pipeline file is in the root of the project and not inside a directory

- Do not enable Auto DevOps!

If you still have issues with this, let me know - I am happy to help.
