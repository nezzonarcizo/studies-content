# GitHub Actions - The Complete Guide


## Section 1 - Getting Started

### Join the Discord Community!

Great to have you on board as a student!

This course also comes with free access to our “**Academind Community**” on Discord: [https://academind.com/community/]

---

There, you can find **more than 200.000 like-minded people**, **discuss** issues, **help each other**, share progress, successes and ideas and simply **have a good time**!

I believe that you learn the most if you **don’t learn alone** but find learning partners and other people with similar interests. Our community is a great place for this - it’s the perfect complimentary resource for this course.

**Joining it is of course free and 100% optional! :-)**


### Course Code Attachments & Slides

You find course resources (code snapshots & slides) on GitHub, in this repository: [https://github.com/academind/github-actions-course-resources]

The folders in the `Code` folder map to the different course sections.

The folders inside those subfolders (e.g., `Code/03 Events/01 Starting Project`) represent individual code snapshots - e.g., the starting project code for a course section.


### Course Setup

For following along with this course, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a free, extensible IDE that works on all operating systems.

A **popular alternative** are the [IDEs offered by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/ides/#choose-your-ide). They offer a variety of IDEs for different programming languages and projects. For web development, [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a popular choice.

As a student of this course, you can get **one Jetbrains IDE for free** for six months!

All you need to do, is select it and enter the following coupon code on the checkout page: **ACAD_JETBRAINS**.

You find detailed instructions regarding the coupon code usage on [this page](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206544449-Redeem-a-coupon-promo-code-or-discount-code).

*Please note: Using Jetbrains IDEs is optional (you could use VS Code)! If you do go for the Jetbrains deal, you'll need to enter your email address during the checkout process.*


## Section 2 - Git & GitHub Crash Course [Optional]

### Configuring Git

After installing Git, you can also configure it - most importantly, you can set a username and email address that will be connected to all your code snapshots.

This can be done via:

>`git config --global user.name "your-username"`

>`git config --global user.email "your-email"`

You can learn more about Git's configuration options here: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config]
