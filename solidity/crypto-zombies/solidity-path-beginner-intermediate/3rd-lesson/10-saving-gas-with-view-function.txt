Awesome! Now we have some special abilities for higher-level zombies, to give our owners an incentive to level them up. We can add more of these later if we want to.

Let's add one more function: our DApp needs a method to view a user's entire zombie army — let's call it getZombiesByOwner.

This function will only need to read data from the blockchain, so we can make it a view function. Which brings us to an important topic when talking about gas 
optimization:

View functions don't cost gas
view functions don't cost any gas when they're called externally by a user.

This is because view functions don't actually change anything on the blockchain – they only read the data. So marking a function with view tells web3.js that it only 
needs to query your local Ethereum node to run the function, and it doesn't actually have to create a transaction on the blockchain (which would need to be run on 
every single node, and cost gas).

We'll cover setting up web3.js with your own node later. But for now the big takeaway is that you can optimize your DApp's gas usage for your users by using read-only 
external view functions wherever possible.

Note: If a view function is called internally from another function in the same contract that is not a view function, it will still cost gas. This is because the other
function creates a transaction on Ethereum, and will still need to be verified from every node. So view functions are only free when they're called externally.
