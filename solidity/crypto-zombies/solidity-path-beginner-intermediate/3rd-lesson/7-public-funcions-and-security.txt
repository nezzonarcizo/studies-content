Now let's modify feedAndMultiply to take our cooldown timer into account.

Looking back at this function, you can see we made it public in the previous lesson. An important security practice is to examine all your public and external 
functions, and try to think of ways users might abuse them. Remember — unless these functions have a modifier like onlyOwner, any user can call them and pass them 
any data they want to.

Re-examining this particular function, the user could call the function directly and pass in any _targetDna or _species they want to. This doesn't seem very 
game-like — we want them to follow our rules!

On closer inspection, this function only needs to be called by feedOnKitty(), so the easiest way to prevent these exploits is to make it internal.
