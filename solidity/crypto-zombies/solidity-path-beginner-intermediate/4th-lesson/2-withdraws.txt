In the previous chapter, we learned how to send Ether to a contract. So what happens after you send it?

After you send Ether to a contract, it gets stored in the contract's Ethereum account, and it will be trapped there — unless you add a function to withdraw the Ether 
from the contract.

You can write a function to withdraw Ether from the contract as follows:

contract GetPaid is Ownable {
  function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    address _owner =  owner();
    _owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }
}
Note that we're using owner() and onlyOwner from the Ownable contract, assuming that was imported.

You can transfer Ether to an address using the transfer function, and address(this).balance will return the total balance stored on the contract. So if 100 users had 
paid 1 Ether to our 
contract, address(this).balance would equal 100 Ether.

You can use transfer to send funds to any Ethereum address. For example, you could have a function that transfers Ether back to the msg.sender if they overpaid for an 
item:

uint itemFee = 0.001 ether;
msg.sender.transfer(msg.value - itemFee);
Or in a contract with a buyer and a seller, you could save the seller's address in storage, then when someone purchases his item, transfer him the fee paid by the 
buyer: 
seller.transfer(msg.value).

These are some examples of what makes Ethereum programming really cool — you can have decentralized marketplaces like this that aren't controlled by anyone.
