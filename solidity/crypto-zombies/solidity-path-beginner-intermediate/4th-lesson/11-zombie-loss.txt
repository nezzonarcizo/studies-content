Now that we've coded what happens when your zombie wins, let's figure out what happens when it loses.

In our game, when zombies lose, they don't level down â€” they simply add a loss to their lossCount, and their cooldown is triggered so they have to wait a day before attacking again.

To implement this logic, we'll need an else statement.

else statements are written just like in JavaScript and many other languages:

if (zombieCoins[msg.sender] > 100000000) {
  // You rich!!!
} else {
  // We require more ZombieCoins...
}
