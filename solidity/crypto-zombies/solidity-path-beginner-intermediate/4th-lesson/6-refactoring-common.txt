Whoever calls our attack function — we want to make sure the user actually owns the zombie they're attacking with. It would be a security concern if you could attack with someone else's zombie!

Can you think of how we would add a check to see if the person calling this function is the owner of the _zombieId they're passing in?

Give it some thought, and see if you can come up with the answer on your own.

Take a moment... Refer to some of our previous lessons' code for ideas...

Answer below, don't continue until you've given it some thought.

The answer
We've done this check multiple times now in previous lessons. In changeName(), changeDna(), and feedAndMultiply(), we used the following check:

require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
This is the same logic we'll need for our attack function. Since we're using the same logic multiple times, let's move this into its own modifier to clean up our code and avoid repeating ourselves.
