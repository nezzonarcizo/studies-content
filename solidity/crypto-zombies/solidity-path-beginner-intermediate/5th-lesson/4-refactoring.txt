Uh oh! We've just introduced an error in our code that will make it not compile. Did you notice it?

In the previous chapter we defined a function called ownerOf. But if you recall from Lesson 4, we also created a modifier with the same name, ownerOf, 
in zombiefeeding.sol.

If you tried compiling this code, the compiler would give you an error saying you can't have a modifier and a function with the same name.

So should we just change the function name in ZombieOwnership to something else?

No, we can't do that!!! Remember, we're using the ERC721 token standard, which means other contracts will expect our contract to have functions with these exact 
names defined. That's what makes these standards useful — if another contract knows our contract is ERC721-compliant, it can simply talk to us without needing to 
know anything about our internal implementation decisions.

So that means we'll have to refactor our code from Lesson 4 to change the name of the modifier to something else.
